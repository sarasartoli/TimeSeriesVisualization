## Project Description
In this project, student will work on the US employment data available on Bureau of Labor and Statistics. Data description can be found on the website. In particular, we will focus on employment rate by state.


## How to Execute
The final version is uploaded as TimeSeriesVisualization.zip. Put the content of the root folder on your root directory and open it in a webbrowser.

## Data File Preprocessing
The data file used for this project is from BLS website. I did some preprocessing (in Python) for following purposes:
1. change date format
2. change data such that the data of each state is stored in a single column.
3. Sorting the Data File Base on date

## Finding 1: Effect of Financial Crisis (2007-2008) on Unemployment Rate
The financial crisis of 2007â€“09, also known as the global financial crisis and the 2008-09 financial crisis, is considered by many economists to have been the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. financial crisis had a great effect on US unemployment rate. The U.S. unemployment rate increased to 10.1% by October 2009, the highest rate since 1983 and roughly twice the pre-crisis rate. you can observe the effect of USA financial crisis in the following figure.
